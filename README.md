Hi there, trap-representation here.

I'm a self-taught C programmer, who likes to write *strcitly standard conforming* code. Heck I have read n1570's section 6.5p6 and p7 so many times now, just to make sure *I'm not mis-interpreting what the standard draft says*, that strict-aliasing doesn't even scare me anymore.

Also, checking return values is great!

I don't really like people who write non-standard code, and thinks that a program that's literally invoking UB will "just work" the same on a Monday afternoon the way it did on a Friday night.

Well, if you're one of those people though, just be sure to look outside your window after you run/compile your code (depends on the type of UB you're invoking), to make sure there is no UFO outside your house.

I also upload demos of the things that build (most of which are VMs, assemblers and compilers) on my YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0j25PUywdrQGOR2jWkuPHg).

PS:
- I don't support the Indian Education System
- Tech support scammers suck
- I support people like Jim Browning and Kitboga

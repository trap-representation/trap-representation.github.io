Hi there, trap-representation here.

I'm a self-taught C programmer, who likes to write *strcitly standard conforming* code. Heck I have read n1570's section 6.5p6 and p7 so many times now, just to make sure *I'm not mis-interpreting what the standard draft says*, that strict-aliasing doesn't even scare me anymore.

Also, checking return values is great!

I don't really like people who write non-standard code, and thinks that a program that's literally invoking UB will "just work" the same on a Monday afternoon the way it did on a Friday night.

Well, if you're one of those people though, just be sure to look outside your window after you run/compile your code (depends on the type of UB you're invoking), to make sure there is no UFO outside your house.

And if you want to see a realistic example of what happens when you invoke UB, check out [this animation I made](https://youtu.be/-gVAP8YMlk0) just for people like you. This is based on a true story... well, semi-true.

I also upload demos of the things that I build (most of which are compilers and implementations of custom instruction sets) on my YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0j25PUywdrQGOR2jWkuPHg).

Also, if you're learning C, here are some tips for you:
- Do **NOT** learn C from YouTube tutorials, because 99% of them are really bad
- Do **NOT** use these books, because they are probably the worst books on C (worst as in misleading and full of made up stuff that are not even true) that you'll ever find: `Let Us C`, `Rudiments of Computer Science`, `Programming in ANSI C`
- Do **NOT** use geeksforgeeks, because 99% of the things there are written by people who don't even have any idea what they're talking about

As a completely self-taught programmer, I had learned a lot of incorrect stuff from these books and websites, heck even my school taught me a heck load of things on C that are totally just made up by the lecturers, and don't even make any sense, and I had to relearn almost everything from scratch. The reason I wrote this is so that you don't have to go through the same pain of relearning everything from scratch like I did.

- I don't support the Indian Education System
- Tech support scammers suck
- We need more people like Jim Browning and Kitboga
